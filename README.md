This application utilizes MongoDB and Express to create a fitness and exercise application, offering data point tracking and consistent tracking for long term fitness goals. Specific exercises can be saved and updated, these exercises are stored within different categories for ease of API usage.

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
